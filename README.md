# Blockchain-Based-Crowdsourcing-Framework-for-Vehicle-to-Vehicle-Charging

A Blockchain-Based Crowdsourcing Framework for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Charging that guarantees the transparency of the system and overcoming the main limitations of the centralized solutions. 

The proposed framework is developed on the Ethereum network using Solidity language. The framework features include registering users, maintaining user information, clustering requesters (charging tasks), collecting preferences lists from requesters and providers,  and lastly selecting the requester-provider charging pair as well as the corresponding meeting point.

# Abstract
<center> Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become a promising solution to entirely replace traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. EV owners face the "Range Anxiety" problem which is the fear that their remaining charge would not be enough to reach their destination. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging is currently being used in exchanging energy between EVs. Most of the existing energy V2V frameworks depend on a centralized server that manages the energy exchange. However,  these solutions may suffer from privacy leakage and misbehaving platform. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a  blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework for V2V charging. The framework features include registering users, maintaining user information, clustering requesters (charging tasks), collecting preferences lists from requesters and providers,  and lastly selecting the requester-provider charging pair as well as the corresponding meeting point. These features are implemented using smart contracts while guaranteeing the transparency of the system and overcoming the main limitations of centralized solutions. Experiment results with real-life dataset show that the proposed framework achieves a  comparable performance at reasonable paid costs and execution times.</center>
